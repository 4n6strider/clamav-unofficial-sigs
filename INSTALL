====================
GENERAL INFORMATION:
====================

The clamav-unofficial-sigs script and accompanying files are provided by Bill Landry
(unofficialsigs@gmail.com) under general BSD licensing guidelines.

The two files needed to download, test and update third-party ClamAV database files
provided by Sanesecurity, SecuriteInfo, MalwarePatrol, OITC, etc., are the script itself
(clamav-unofficial-sig.sh), and the user configuration file (clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf).

Since the user configuration section has been separated from the script itself, the script now
needs to reference the configuration file when run by using the "-c" flag when running the script.
It is also recommended that a copy of the configuration file be place in the "default" location
"/etc" so that it can be used when running the script manually without using the "-c" flag, or
when running the script with the "-d" (decode virus signature), "-g" (check gpg signature), or
"-s" (check database integrity) flags.  This also provides a way to run the script with different
configuration options when run via cron versus when run manually.

Script updates can be found at: https://github.com/extremeshok/clamav-unofficial-sigs

==========================
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
==========================

WARNING:  Renaming any of the files included in the tarball may cause the script to fail to remove
all files, databases, and work directories from the system if the '-r' (remove script) flag is used.


Make sure you do not have the package installed via yum/apt
  yum purge clamav-unofficial-sigs

Uncompress/Unpackage the tarball:
   tar -zxf clamav-unofficial-sigs.tar.gz

Move into the package directory:
   cd clamav-unofficial-sigs-(version)

Make sure script files are executable and have the appropriate UID/GID set:
   chmod 755 *.sh
   chown <user>:<group> *.sh

Configure:
   Edit the clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf file
   IMPORTANT CONFIGURATION CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Make sure that the PATH statement correctly defines the location of your binary files.  These
     include: find, sed, awk, cut, grep, tail, chown, chmod, cmp, diff, dig, host, gzip, ls, cp, mv,
     test, gpg, xargs, sleep, urandom, chksum, rsync, curl, socat, etc.  It has been reported that
     on Sun systems, the GNU utilities should be used rather than the default Sun versions.
   - System shell setting:  Based on user feedback, it has been reported that "sh" works best for
     BSD variants, "ksh" for Sun Solaris, and "bash" for Linux variants.  If you experience problems
     running the script, please try editing the top line of the script file and changing "sh" to
     either "ksh" or "bash" before reporting a problem.
   - Adjust configuration settings to meet your system requirements.

Install:
   cp -f clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh
   cp -f clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf /etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf
   cp -f clamav-unofficial-sigs.8 /usr/share/man/man8/clamav-unofficial-sigs.8
   cp -f clamav-unofficial-sigs-cron /etc/cron.d/clamav-unofficial-sigs-cron
   cp -f clamav-unofficial-sigs-logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/clamav-unofficial-sigs-logrotate

==================
USAGE INFORMATION:
==================

To run at specific time intervals, either use the include cron file or edit the user crontab:
   /etc/cron.d/clamav-unofficial-sigs-cron

To run manually:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh

===================
SCRIPT FLAGS USAGE:
===================

To create a bypass signature for temporarily resolving a false-positive issue with a third-party signature:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -b

To direct the script to use an alternate configuration file other than the one in /etc:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -c /path/to/clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf

To decode a hexadecimal encoded string or specific third-party signature and determine what database it is in:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -d

To encode an entire data string in hexadecimal for signature use in any '*.ndb' file:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -e

To encode a formatted data string that contains field spacers '{}, (), *' in hexadecimal, without encoding the
   field spacers, for signature use in any '*.ndb' file:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -f

To GPG Signature test a specific Sanesecurity database file:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -g filename  (e.g., -g junk.ndb)

To view Help and Usage instructions:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -h

To output script configuration and system information:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -i

To make a hexadecimal signature database file (*.ndb) from a clear text ascii file:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -m

To completely remove the script and all of its associated files, databases and work directories:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -r

To clamscan integrity test a specific database file:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -s filename  (e.g., -s junk.ndb)

To output third-party signature names that triggered during local HAM directory scanning,
   if enabled in the configuration file:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -t

To check version:
   /usr/local/bin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh -v
